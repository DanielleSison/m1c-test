# Nux Provocatio XXII

## URL: https://daniellesison.github.io/nux-provocatio-xxii/

## Description

This activity was completed to edit a webpage from a marketing agency "Horiseon" that follows accessbility standards that would result in its optimization for search engines. Edited content, code, and styling resolves the lacking elements that it required to fulfill the consumer's acceptance criteria. 

The following were added or edited into the code and styling, but not limited to:

<ul>
<li>Semantic HTML elements</li>
<li>Image alt attributes</li>
<li>Organization of the code as stated by the Scout's Rule</li>
</ul>

The challenge had allowed me to learn different aspects of HTML and CSS rules that would be required for future activities.
